j-play
======

This is the source for the Chrome extension J-Play, which creates a game
oriented view of the archived content on j-archive.com.  Browsing to any
game on the j-archive.com website lets you toggle the game style to play
along in broadcast order.

You can install the J-Play extension from the Chrome extension store, or you
can use Chrome's developer mode to load an unpacked extension by browsing to
the extension directory in this git checkout.

Please feel free to contribute improvements for the extension, which I will be
glad to consider incorporating into my version.  If you use this code to create
your own published extension, be sure to mention the Copyright in the public
listing.
